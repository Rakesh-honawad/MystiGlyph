# MystiGlyph
MystiGlyph is a custom-built virtual keyboard that translates every typed alphabet into a unique symbolic language designed by me. What looks like random glyphs to others is actually a coded script—ideal for hidden communication, personal encryption, or creative expression.
### ✨ Coming soon: AI-powered decryption using a private key and cipher logic!

In future versions, MystiGlyph will include an AI-based decryption system that securely interprets symbols using cipher techniques combined with a user-defined private key—blending creativity, encryption, and intelligence.


# 🔮 MystiGlyph – The Symbolic Keyboard of Tomorrow

**MystiGlyph** is an experimental keyboard project that translates standard alphabets into a **custom symbolic language** created by me. It's a new way to type hidden or stylized messages that only those familiar with the symbols—or those holding the decryption key—can understand.

---

## ✨ Features (Current)
- 🧠 **Custom Symbol Mapping**: Each typed character is instantly converted into a unique symbol.
- 🎹 **Virtual Keyboard Interface**: Built for browser interaction with a clean layout.
- 🔒 **Visual Obfuscation**: Messages appear in symbols—undecipherable to outsiders.

---

## 🚀 Coming Soon
### 🧠 AI-Powered Encryption Button
- A dedicated button to **generate encrypted messages** using AI and a cipher algorithm.
- Optional **private key input** to control message access and decoding.
- A decryption engine that works via:
  - Manual interpretation (if the user knows the symbolic language)
  - AI + private key (for secure decoding)

> 🔐 *The AI and cipher integration is currently under development.*

## 💡 How it Works
1. Type using the virtual keyboard or your physical keyboard.
2. Each character is mapped to a symbolic representation in real-time.
3. Future versions will allow AI to encrypt full sentences.
4. Recipients can decrypt messages **only if they know the symbols or the key**.
